# Example tuple
food_stuff_tp = ('apple', 'banana', 'orange', 'carrot', 'broccoli', 'spinach', 'meat', 'milk', 'eggs')

# Remove the reference to the tuple
del food_stuff_tp

# Try to print the tuple (will result in an error because the tuple no longer exists)
print(food_stuff_tp)  # Uncommenting this line would raise a NameError

# The del statement is used to remove the reference to the food_stuff_tp tuple, making it inaccessible. 
# If you try to print or access food_stuff_tp after the del statement, it will result in a NameError.
